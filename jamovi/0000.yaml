  This module is for estimation, providing analyses that focus on effect sizes,
  uncertainty, and synthesis.  This module is designed for ease of use and
  provides high-quality visualizations that emphasize effect sizes and
  uncertainty.</br></br>

  Currently, all analyses are frequentist, returning confidence
  intervals.</br></br>

  This is an alpha release.  Please submit feedback, bug reports, and feature

  0.9.4 ----</br>
    * Updating analyses to build graphs from data directly; should eliminate problems occuring on OSx and some Chromebooks</br>
  0.9.3 ----</br>
    * Additional update to try to fix estimate correlation of OSx.  Hopefully fixed this time.</br>
  0.9.2 ----</br>
    * Updated estimate correlation to hopefully prevent crashes on OSx - Thanks to JLove's suggested code</br>
    * Split estimate means into descriptives and estimate means</br>
    * Fixed a bug for Mdiff where cohen's d didn't take the conf.level argument</br>
